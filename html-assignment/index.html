  <h2> About me</h2>
 
  <p>I am supposed two write two paragraphs about myself here but sadly I am really not that interesting to talk about
     and spent most of my years playing video games, attempting to get decent at drawing but losing motivation and <em>struggling</em> with school.
      The past few years I've actually been sort of obsessed with self improvement and learning new things, 
      this class and interactive media design in general seems really interesting so far and it's really enjoyable.
       I am <em>finally</em> motivated to learn new skills and contribute to my community
      and society in general. <sup>thanks for reading :3</sup>
